Meeting minutes - November 6th 2018 (no recording):

Status:
Internationalization work for the desktop is mostly complete and under code review.
Plugin Internationalization will happen on a case by case basis and is progressing.
A formal conformance program is being worked on. Several tentative rules have been identified and are being applied to plugins progressively.
RBAC framework work is in code review. Once completed, the changes will then be applied to services and later to plugins, on a case by case basis.
The FTP plugin work continues.
The SQL Editor is also being reworked based on tentative conformance rules.
A first rough draft of the troubleshooting guide has been created and will be edited shortly.

Conversation topics:
In order to increase community involvement, hosting of a workshop was discussed. This would be a by invitation only small group of active non-fonding-member community users who have JavaScript skills and are interested in becoming proponent of the platform through active development and slack channel participation.
Interested parties can reach out to @Sean Grady and @JP Linardon on the zowe-dev channel.
Note that this is not part of the zowe-boarding effort as the goal is to recruit and train developers for the virtual desktop explicitly.
