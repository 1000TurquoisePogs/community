# Zowe Docs Squad - 20PI4 Objectives (October 2020 to December 2020)

1. Zowe users can learn about and use new Zowe features successfully by reading the documentation. 
   
   **Deliverable:** 
   
   Documentation for new features and enhancements of each release are published on the doc site, including but are not limited to the following ones:
   - Document the Swift SDK (in addition to the Python and Node SDKs)
   - Document the Zowe Docker support

   **Dependency:** All squads

   **Risk:** Zowe release schedule changes. Need to follow up closely to prepare the doc site, fix issues, and publish doc on time. 

2. Zowe users can get and browse a list of interested topics within a few clicks by selecting an area of interest, role, and skill level. [#1257](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1257)
   
   **Deliverable:** 
   - Buttons on Zowe doc site that users can select. 
   - Topics on the doc site are tagged and organized by applicable component, user role, and skill level. 
   - Present a list of topics based on user's choice.

   **Dependency:** 
   - On-boarding squad (collaborate on identifying personas, resources)
   - Systems squad or web UI squad (potential build and UI review)

   **Risk:**
   - Resource and holiday. This is relatively big chunk of work in addition to regular doc delivery.

3. Zowe contributors can begin contributing to the documentation by reading the contribution guide on the doc site. [#1276](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1276) and [#1179](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1179)
   
   **Deliverable:** 
   - Publish enriched contribution documentation and guidelines on the doc site that contain clear process, links to related education, examples, and demos where necessary.
   - Separate maintainer doc with contributor doc. 

   **Dependency and risk:** None

4. Zowe users can read more useful documentation (primarily developer facing doc) on the doc site instead of the GitHub wikis that are maintained separately in dev repos. 
   
   **Deliverable:**
   - Create a workflow that allows the documentation being written and published by devs on the Github wiki to migrate to the doc site more efficiently.
   - Standardization of technical terminology between the two docs. 

   **Dependency and risk:** None

5. Zowe users can learn about Zowe CLI through more lightweight and versatile content, including tips and examples, and use case articles. 

   **Deliverable:**   
   - More tips/examples about issuing commands
   - More Zowe CLI use case articles

   **Dependency and risk:** None

6. Address a list of GitHub doc enhancement issues and user feedback to provide better content experience and help users work with Zowe. 
   
   **Deliverable:**

   - CLI - document the plugin profile types [issue #487](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/487)
