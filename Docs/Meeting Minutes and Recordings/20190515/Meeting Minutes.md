## Agenda 

- Define Zowe Docs ZenHub pipeline/workflow 
  - Reference article: https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000206560
  - What each pipleline means, add a description to each pipeline
    - **New Issues** Newly created Issues land here automatically. 
    - **Icebox**	Low priority, un-prioritized Issues that are not immediate priorities. (Doc impact evaluated but not priority in short term)
    - **Backlog**	Upcoming Issues that are immediate priorities. Issues here should be prioritized top-to-bottom in the pipeline. (What will be worked next)
    - **In Progress**	What the team is currently working on, ordered by priority. (Making changes)
    - **Review Q/A**	Issues open to the team for review and testing. Usually this means the code/doc is ready to be deployed pending feedback.  (PR opened and reviewers assigned. Or review is ongoing offline)
    - **Done**	Issues that are tested and ready to be deployed to production. (Do we need this one? )
	- **Closed** Issues that have been closed.
  - Create epics to help us better track issues
