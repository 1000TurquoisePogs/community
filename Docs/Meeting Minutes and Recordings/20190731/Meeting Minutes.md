## Agenda 

- v1.4.0: RC3 Wednesday
- Zowe.org transferred to Ashley, zTrial added
- `forward-validation` branch, to summarize
   - What it does: include major changes that we want to validate in preparation to publish them as part of 2.0.0. For the CLI, for example, the forward development version has different release notes, different installation steps, different commands available, and different plug-ins available early.
   - When to use it: If your team wants to get validation on a feature, you can document it in this branch.
