## Blog preparation

**Blogs should:**
 - Be brief (generally < 1200; > 500 words)
 - Focus on a target audience
 - Be relevant
   - The title and first paragraph should compel the viewer to take the time to read the piece.  The content should be relevant and helpful for the target audience.

 - Leverage visuals (screenshots, GIFs, etc.), especially an eye-catching featured image  
   - See public, license-free sites like unsplash.com

**Discoverability (search results):**

 - Determine which Google search keywords are best suited for your content and target audience (i.e., what are you communicating and to whom?  What keywords are they likely to use?).  Include these keywords in your title and related words in the body, especially the first paragraph.

 - Be sure your title, opening paragraph (and featured image) will stand out in a search by your target audience (i.e., will it get people to click your entry over all the other Google results?)

## Publishing steps

 - Create a Medium handle.  
 - Let [zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org](email:zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org) know your handle so you can be added as a “writer” for the publication.  To see your handle select your profile picture when you log into medium.com, it will begin with an `@` symbol, e.g. `@myusername_1974.  

### When ready to write

 - Go to [Medium.com](https://medium.com)
 - Click your profile (should be logged in)
 - Click New Story
 - Begin editing
 - If needed, save as “draft”
 - Include the following at the end of your blog: [See more Zowe blogs here](https://medium.com/zowe)
 - Include 5 tags like: “Zowe”, “Mainframe”, “DevOps”, “Open Source”, [specific technology like COBOL, vscode], [specific roles like Sysprog], etc.

### When ready to publish

 - You may need to add the publication to your profile (Profile => Publication => New Publication)
 - Double check: be sure you have...
   - compelling title and opening paragraph (discoverability is critical!)
   - featured image and visuals in place.  By default the first image will be associated with the blog post, however you can choose to use a different headline image by navigating to the image while in edit mode, select it manually, and press `Shift + F`. 
   - appropriate links and tags
 - While editing the story, click “…”
 - Click “Add to Publication”
 - If applicable, uncheck “Allow curators to recommend my story to interested readers.”
 - Click “Submit to Publication”
 - The blog will remain Pending until the publication owner posts it

 ## Content guidelines

 As a blog writer you can write about any topic that you're interested in and that will provide value to the Zowe community.  The content on our blog consists of:

 - Articles about core Zowe projects, Zowe incubation projects, or Zowe conformant offerings
 - Technical content and how-to's
 - Stories about Zowe deployments
 - Use cases and success stories
 - Reports from Zowe events

 Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the Zowe community
 
 Blogs fall into one of two categories and are differentiated to avoid a user visiting a Zowe blogsite from misunderstanding the relationship between whether the content being described is free open source software included with a Long Term Support (LTS) Zowe release, a commermcial vendor Zowe offerings, or a project in its incubation phase.

 - [Core Zowe](#core-zowe)
 - [Zowe Ecosystem](#zowe-ecosystem)
 - [Zowe Incubation](#zowe-incubation)

 To distinghish between three three categories blogs ...  

### Core Zowe
 
 These articles should reference content that is owned and managed by the Open Mainframe Project residing as source code in [https://github.com/zowe](https://github.com/zowe) repositories.  Core Zowe content is available for a user to download on [https://www.zowe.org/#download](https://www.zowe.org/#download) as well as the Visual Studio Marketplace plugin [Zowe Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe).

 Core Zowe articles may also reference other open source technologies such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), and other products available under permissive open source licenses such as [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [Berkley Software Distribution (BSD)](http://www.ipglossary.com/glossary/berkeley-software-distribution-license-bsd-license/#.XEiHtlwzaUk),  [Eclipse Public License (EPL)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/faq.php), [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/), [Microsoft Public License](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/top-10-microsoft-public-license-ms-pl-questions-answered), [Common Development and Distribution License(CDDL)](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/top-10-common-development-and-distribution-license-cddl-questions-answered).

 A user visiting an blog post on Core Zowe should be able to operate all of the software described in the article through open source license.

 Posts must be vendor-neutral, although the author is allowed to describe their bio in relation to their role at a commercial company, (e.g. Janet is lead systems programmer at mainframewidgets.com), including links to social media handles.

### Zowe ecosystem

Zowe is a tooling platform which includes a number of frameworks allowing it to be extended by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) or System Integrators (SIs).  Zowe extension offerings that are proven to meet the acceptance criteria for interoperating with Zowe are awarded a Zowe conformance badge, see [Zowe conformance](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/conformance).

Articles written about the Zowe ecosystem are welcome as they show the diversity of the platform and the capabilities a mainframe user can enjoy when using Zowe alongside one or more of its conformant products.

The post may mention a vendor's name as it relates to Zowe, project deployments, adoption paths, their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event including virtual events, indications of meaingful participation in the community, but it shouldn't feel like an advertisement for services of your company.  

Content that discusses a vendor's commemrcial offering should be in relation to Zowe, although background for the commercial offering may be included as long as it does not exceed 15% of the article content and is valuable to set the scene for the technical offering and its usage in relation to how it has been exploited through use of the Zowe conformant scenarios.  Revelent descriptions of vendor technology with hyperlinks to further material hosted on other sites, including how a reader can find out more about the commmercial offering, are encouraged as long as they do not become an advertisement. It is encouraged that the linked to sites hosted by companies for readers to find out more information on the vendor offering mention Zowe with correct trademark attribution.  

Announcements or press releases are not accepted as Zowe blogs.

### Zowe incubation

Zowe provides for projects to be in incubation that may not be currently in core Zowe, yet has value to promote and share with the community.  Articles written about technology in the incubation phase are welcome.  A core Zowe project should
