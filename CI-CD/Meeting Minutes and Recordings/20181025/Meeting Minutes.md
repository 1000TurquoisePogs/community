Roundtable

Jack
- Jack will publish build at 2:00 pm along with Documentation. Will work with Brandon to get documentation updated as well
- Investigate how we can sign the build in the Automation.
- Documentation versioning PR created and Ashley will validate if the changes are good for next

Mark
- Investigation to be done: All sub-projects need to version on a regular cadence instead of locking down build. PAX build targets latest stable release. Will contact Eamon to see if he can driver this change.
- Will follow up with Petr to include their automation in the pipeline
- ZLC migration plan for repositories. Creating markdown file that describes each repo and what they need.

John
- Jay working with VJ about rebooting the zTrial machine.
