The primary goal of Zowe Explorer squad would include (but not limited to):

• Maintain and enhance Zowe Explorer extension as a common component for VSCode and hosted IDE's like Theia, Eclipse Che etc. 
• Deliver Zowe Explorer as part of Zowe Core including an offline package delivered on Zowe.org similar to the offline package for Zowe CLI
• Formalize extensions to Zowe Explorer by means of well documented extension points and, if applicable, also define conformance rules
• Work with other squads in Zowe to ensure tighter integration, code re-use while keeping in mind the overall end to end user experience
